Ensuring we get our back end running smoothly. Having it communicate with the mongo database and our front end.
Communicating with my partner to make sure we are on the right track.

**In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?**
Domaine 
Being able to write executable code for the backend using express js .
Eric
Being able to express my thoughts.

**Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?**

Letting each other know where we are at in regards to the project.
Having a to do list so we can tackle each aspect of the assignment.
Making sure to complete every daily to do list with everything working as it should.

### Conflict-Resolution

**What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?**

Let the other person know and talk about why they are not helping.
This is so we try and get back to the same page, by establishing why the issue is happening.

**What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?**

We’ll remind each other of our divided roles and why it is we chose to assign them the way we did. We will also talk about why that person feels the need to take over and see if we can eliminate or fix whatever is making them feel that way.

**How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?**

By communicating with each other. Things like asking for help when stuck or not understanding how something works. Asking for help when you feel overwhelmed and so on.
